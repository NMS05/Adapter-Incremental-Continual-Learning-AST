# Adapter-Incremental-Continual-Learning-AST

This repo provides the official PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Adapter Incremental Continual Learning of Efficient Audio Spectrogram Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14314.pdf) which is presented at INTERSPEECH 2023. Run AICL_train.py to train the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) in a Task Incremental Continual Learning setup.
